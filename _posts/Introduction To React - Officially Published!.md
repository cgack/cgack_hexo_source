It has been a while since I posted that I was writing a second book, _[Introduction to React](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-React-Cory-Gackenheimer/dp/1484212460/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1442342177&sr=8-1)._ Today it is officially available in both ebook and paperback formats. I hope you enjoy reading the book and the introduction to React as much as I enjoyed writing it.

_[Introduction to React](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-React-Cory-Gackenheimer-ebook/dp/B00ZHM53D0/ref=mt_kindle?_encoding=UTF8&me=)_ teaches you React, the JavaScript framework created by developers at Facebook, to solve the problem of building complex user interfaces in a consistent and maintainable way. React.js shrugs away common front-end conventions in an effort to make things more efficient – use Introduction to React to learn about this framework and more today.  

You will learn what React is, and why it was created to solve the problems it does. You will get to know the React API, and be introduced to React’s specific JavaScript extension, JSX, which makes authoring React components easier and maintainable. You will also learn how you can test your React applications and the tools you can use while building. Once you understand these core concepts, you can build applications with React. This will help you cement the ideas and fundamentals of React and prepare you to utilize React in your own use case.  

### What you’ll learn

How to use React to maintain complex user interfaces in an efficient way  
How to integrate existing user interfaces and move forward with React  
How to manage application architecture using Flux  
How to easily utilize JSX, React’s JavaScript extension  

### Who this book is for
