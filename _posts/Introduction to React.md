A few months ago I was approached by my editor from [Node.js Recipes](http://www.amazon.com/Node-js-Recipes-Problem-Solution-Approach-Development/dp/1430260580/ref=la_B00J3AF2VA_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1436188426&sr=1-1) to discuss the possiblity of writing another book. This coincided with a time where I had been spending time working with React for side projects, and it just so happened that the title which I would be writing is [Introduction To React](http://www.apress.com/9781484212462).

Â So I decided to write the book and spent the next 11 weeks writing it. I am currently finishing up the edits and the book is due to be published in September. I'll be sure to update as the publication date approaches.
